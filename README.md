# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
In this project we will detect Faces with OpenCV using harcascades.
A video is also added with it. You can just download this repositry from here and can run it on your machine. You can change video in line number 7 and test it for your video as well. You can also use camera of your device by simply putting 0 in  place of your video path. You can also use your images in image recognition code. Also keep in mind that OpenCV is not a SOTA (State of the art) model so it it is not that accurate. Once you will run the program you have to press 'q' to quit that video.
